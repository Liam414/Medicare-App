Health goals: the safety properties, then the ordinary CRUD.

The first group is the point of the feature. `core/goal_structuring.py` lets a
model rearrange a person's words and nothing else, and the way that is enforced
is a set of deterministic checks rather than a paragraph in a prompt. These
tests are what make that claim true: each one hands the parser a model answer
that invents something and asserts the whole draft is discarded.
