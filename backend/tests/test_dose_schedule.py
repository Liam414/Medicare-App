Tests for the reminder-time suggestion rules.

Every frequency string here is synthetic. The point of these tests is the
refusals as much as the matches: this module is only allowed to propose a
schedule for a plain daily rhythm it recognises, and must decline everything
else rather than guess. A wrong guess here moves when someone takes a
medicine.
