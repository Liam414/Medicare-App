"""
Shared pytest fixtures.

No live Postgres is available in this environment (or in CI-lite runs), so
DB-touching tests override `get_db` with a SQLite in-memory session for the
duration of the test. Schema is created fresh per test from the same
SQLAlchemy models used against real Postgres, so the tables/columns under
test match production shape; SQLite does diverge from Postgres on some
column-level behavior (e.g. strict typing, some constraint enforcement), so
these tests are not a substitute for running against real Postgres before
release.

# ⛔ THE COST FACTOR IS LOWERED FOR TESTS ONLY, AND test_security.py ASSERTS
# THE REAL ONE IS NOT. bcrypt is deliberately slow: at the configured cost of
# 12 a single hash takes ~0.166s, and `verify_dummy` burns a second one on
# every failed login to keep the timing of "no such account" and "wrong
# password" indistinguishable. That is right in production and it dominated
# the suite here — test_appointments_api.py alone spent 54s, of which 0.3s was
# the tests and the rest was hashing synthetic passwords nobody attacks.
#
# ⛔ This weakens hashing inside pytest, so on its own it would mean the suite
# could no longer notice production being weakened the same way. It does not,
# because `test_the_production_cost_factor_is_not_the_test_one` reads the real
# configuration in a fresh interpreter, out of this swap's reach, and asserts
# its cost is still >= 12. Lower the real one and that test fails.

    No test may reach the Census geocoder over the network.

    Provider distances are geocoded from real street addresses
    (`app/services/provider_geo.py`), so without this fixture any test that
    calls /providers/search would make a live third-party request - slow,
    flaky, and dependent on someone else's uptime.

    The default answer is an empty dict, which means "the service answered for
    nothing". That exercises the fallback path: distances drop back to the
    ZIP-centroid estimate and nothing is written to the cache. Tests that want
    real coordinates patch `geocode_addresses` themselves.

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def _no_live_model(monkeypatch):
    """
    No test may reach a live model, free or paid.

    The same rule as `_no_live_geocoding` above, and it exists because the
    suite broke it: putting a working `LLM_BASE_URL` in `backend/.env` — the
    documented way to switch the model layer on — made unstubbed tests call
    that endpoint for real. Against a local model that turned an 85-second run
    into minutes; against a hosted one it would have been someone's money and
    someone's rate limit, and the descriptions in these tests would have left
    the machine.

    The paid path was exposed the same way the whole time: `credentials_
    available()` also honours `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and a stored CLI login
    profile, so a developer signed in locally was one unstubbed test away from
    live billed calls.

    Two things are neutralised, because there are two ways to reach a model:

    * the endpoint settings, so `llm.configured()` is False and `llm.chat`
      refuses before it opens a socket;
    * `_build_client`, which is where the Anthropic SDK resolves credentials
      from the environment and a profile on disk — neither of which a setting
      can clear.

    `_build_client` is the right seam rather than `_classify_with_anthropic`,
    and the difference matters: stubbing the whole classifier would have left
    the response-handling tests in test_triage.py passing without running the
    code they exist to cover, because they assert a raise and
    TriageNotConfigured is a TriageUnavailable. Blocking only the client keeps
    that parsing live while still opening no socket.

    Tests that want a model layer set it up themselves — `stub_triage` here,
    `script` and `endpoint_configured` in test_deduction.py, and the
    `_build_client` / `_classify_with_model` patches in test_triage.py — and
    every one of those runs after this fixture, so opting in still works.
