"""
The pass-through invariant for patient identity.

The design decision these guard: a booking API needs legal name, date of birth,
sex assigned at birth and home address, and MedHelp handles those **without
storing them**. Every test here exists to make that property enforceable rather
than merely intended - the sort of thing that otherwise erodes the first time
somebody adds a convenience column.

All fixtures are synthetic people.

        ⛔ THE REFUSAL MUST COME BEFORE THE BODY IS READ, NOT AFTER.

        The endpoint's docstring says it "refuses before reading the body's
        meaning ... so no identity is processed while there is nowhere to send
        it". That was not true: `identity: BookingIdentity` is a body
        parameter, so pydantic parsed and validated the request into a model
        holding a legal name, a date of birth and a home address *before* the
        handler ran and checked `delivery_available()`.

        The proof was a malformed body answering 422 — a code that can only be
        produced by validation having happened.

        A 422 here is therefore the regression: it means the body was read. A
        503 means the gate ran first and no `BookingIdentity` was constructed
        at all. FastAPI resolves dependencies before validating a body, which
        is what makes the fix a dependency rather than a reordered statement.

        The exposure this closes is small — nothing stored it, nothing returned
        it, and `__repr__` is redacted — but this is the one endpoint in the app
        that touches a date of birth, and its whole design is "two independent
