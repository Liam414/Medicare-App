Tests for the development-only classification log.

This module exists to make classifier quality reviewable, and it does that by
writing the one thing this app is otherwise careful never to log: the user's
own description of their symptoms. So the tests that matter most here are not
about the happy path — they are about the log staying shut.

CLAUDE.md: "Do not log request/response bodies that contain user health data."
The escape hatch below is narrow on purpose, and these tests are what keep it
narrow. Every description used here is synthetic.
