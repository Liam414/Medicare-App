"""
Tests for how a provider's distance is decided.

Covers the cache (so the geocoder is not re-asked), the fallback path (so an
outage costs precision and not results), and the rule that a zero is never
shown. All providers and addresses are synthetic.

The `_no_live_geocoding` fixture in conftest.py already blocks real network
calls; every test here installs its own stub on top of that.
