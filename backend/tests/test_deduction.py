"""
Tests for the agentic deduction layer and the free model client.

These sit alongside `test_triage.py` and defend the same one-directional
property: the system may over-triage, but nothing here — a refusal, a
malformed answer, an endpoint that never replies, a model that argues for
reassurance — may resolve toward "you're fine".

No live model calls are made. `llm.chat` is scripted throughout, and every
description is synthetic.
