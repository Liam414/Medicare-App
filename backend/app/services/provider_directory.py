"""
Client for the NPPES NPI Registry - the provider directory behind the
"find a doctor near me" screen.

NPPES (National Plan and Provider Enumeration System) is published by CMS and
is the authoritative US registry of enumerated healthcare providers. It is a
free public API, no key and no registration:

    https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api/?version=2.1&postal_code=...

Why this source, and what it is not
-----------------------------------
It is a *directory*, not a booking system. NPPES knows who providers are,
where they practise and what they are enumerated to do. It knows nothing about
appointment availability, and there is no slot or calendar data to be had here
at any price. Anything in this app that looked like "next available: Thursday
2pm" would therefore have to be invented, so nothing in this app says it.

What is transmitted, and why that is acceptable
-----------------------------------------------
Unlike the MedlinePlus call (see CLAUDE.md), this request carries **no health
information about the user**. It sends a postal code and a care-setting
category drawn from the fixed list below. It never sends the user's symptom
description, their intake tier, or their identity - there is no field on this
call that could hold one.

The care-setting categories are deliberately *settings* ("Urgent Care",
"Emergency Medicine") rather than conditions. A category like "Oncology" in a
query log would say something about the person asking; "Urgent Care" does not.
Callers may not pass an arbitrary taxonomy string, which is what
`CARE_SETTINGS` enforces.

Because no PHI is transmitted, CMS does not need to be a business associate
for this call path - which is what makes it usable today, when no vendor in
this project has signed a BAA.
