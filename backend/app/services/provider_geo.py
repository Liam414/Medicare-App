"""
How far each provider is from the ZIP the user searched.

Sits between `provider_directory` (who the providers are), `address_geocoder`
(where their addresses are) and `zip_geography` (where a ZIP is), and is the
only place that decides what number the screen gets.

## The problem this solves

Distances used to be measured centroid to centroid, which has **no resolution
below one ZIP code**. Since `search_providers` queries NPPES by the exact ZIP
first, most results sit *in* the searched ZIP, and a ZIP's centroid is zero
miles from itself. A real search of Las Vegas 89109 returned five of six
providers at "~0.0 mi", for clinics up to three miles apart and up to three
miles from the user. The number was not merely imprecise; it was the same
number for everyone, so it could not be used to choose between them.

Geocoding the provider's street address replaces one half of that measurement
with a real point. The same search now returns 0.4, 1.6, 1.9, 2.5 and 2.9
miles.

## What is still approximate, and why the "~" stays

**The user's half is still a ZIP centroid.** They typed a ZIP, or their
coordinate was reduced to one, so the app knows where they are only to
ZIP-code resolution - and it is deliberately not told anything finer, because
a user's precise location is data this app has chosen not to collect for this
purpose. The provider end is now exact; the user end is the centre of their
ZIP.

So the honest reading of "~2.5 mi" is "about two and a half miles from the
middle of your ZIP code". In a dense urban ZIP that is close to the truth. In
a large rural one the user's own half can be off by miles. It is also a
straight line, never a driving distance. The UI keeps the "~" for all of this,
and `ProviderSearchScreen` keeps its note saying the app cannot promise a
route.

## Failure never costs results

The providers are already in hand by the time this runs. A geocoder outage,
an unplaceable address or an unknown ZIP downgrades to the centroid estimate,
and where even that is meaningless the answer is None - which the client
already renders as no distance at all, rather than as a zero.
