Suggesting reminder times from a medication's frequency text.

READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING HERE.

## What this is, and what it is not

This module proposes *alarm times for a reminder*. It does not interpret a
prescription, and nothing it returns is dosing advice.

CLAUDE.md is explicit that the directions line is carried verbatim and that
expanding an abbreviation into dosing instructions would be app-authored
clinical content, because a wrong expansion changes when someone takes a
medicine. That rule is why this module is shaped the way it is:

* **It never edits, rewrites, or replaces the frequency text.** The sig line
  is displayed verbatim beside whatever this proposes, so the user is always
  comparing a suggestion against the real thing.
* **Nothing it returns takes effect on its own.** The API returns these as a
  suggestion, the user reviews the times on screen, and no reminder exists
  until they save. Same read-then-confirm shape as the label scanner: the app
  proposes, a person decides.
* **It declines far more readily than it guesses.** Anything not on the
  explicit lists below returns no suggestion at all, with a reason the UI can
  show, and the user adds times themselves. Not recognising a frequency is a
  safe outcome; inventing a schedule for it is not.

## The times themselves are conveniences, not clinical choices

"Twice daily" does not mean 08:00 and 20:00 — it means twice a day, and which
hours suit depends on the person, the drug, and instructions this app never
sees. The clock times below are neutral waking-hours defaults chosen only so
the user has something to adjust rather than an empty form. Every one of them
is editable before anything is saved.

## Deliberately not recognised

* **"As needed" / PRN.** An as-needed medicine has no schedule, and an alarm
  telling someone to take one is actively wrong. Recognised only in order to
  refuse it, with a reason.
* **Anything that is not a simple daily rhythm** — weekly, every other day,
  cycled courses. The reminder model here is daily times; a frequency that
  does not fit that shape gets no suggestion rather than a wrong one.
* **Food, timing and route qualifiers** ("with meals", "on an empty stomach",
  "before bed") are not acted on beyond the bedtime case below. They stay in
  the verbatim text where the user can read them.

# ⛔ EVERY WAY A LABEL SAYS "ONLY IF YOU NEED IT" BELONGS HERE, INCLUDING THE
# ONES BRITISH PHARMACIES PRINT. This list carried "as required", "when needed"
# and "if needed" — three of the four combinations of {as, when} x {needed,
# required} — and missed "when required", which is exactly how a UK label
# writes PRN. So "TAKE 1 TABLET EVERY 4 HOURS WHEN REQUIRED" was read as a
# plain four-hourly interval and proposed six alarms a day including 00:00 and
# 04:00: the app waking somebody at four in the morning to take an as-needed
# painkiller. Found 2026-09-20 by running real-world sig lines through this
# function; `test_british_phrasings_of_as_needed_are_never_scheduled` holds it.
#
# ⛔ Extending this list is one-directional and therefore safe: every addition
# can only make `suggest_times` refuse MORE, never schedule more. The cost of a
# wrong refusal is the minute it takes somebody to type their own times; the
# cost of a wrong schedule is an alarm telling them to take a medicine they may
# not need. Add freely; never remove without the clinical review CLAUDE.md
# says these phrase lists are still waiting for.
