"""
Chat client for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, with tool calling.

WHY THIS EXISTS: the triage model layer used to be reachable only through a
paid Anthropic key, so a deployment without one ran on rules alone. Every
free way to run a model — a hosted free tier or a model on your own machine —
serves the same wire format, `POST {base_url}/chat/completions` with a
`tools` array of JSON-schema functions. They differ in three strings:

    | Provider            | LLM_BASE_URL                                         | Key |
    |---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----|
    | Ollama (local)      | http://localhost:11434/v1                            | no  |
    | llama.cpp (local)   | http://localhost:8080/v1                             | no  |
    | Groq (free tier)    | https://api.groq.com/openai/v1                       | yes |
    | Google AI Studio    | https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai | yes |
    | OpenRouter (:free)  | https://openrouter.ai/api/v1                         | yes |

So this is one client, not a provider abstraction: there is a single request
shape and a single response shape, and the vendor is configuration.

⛔ WHICH BASE URL YOU CHOOSE IS A DATA-HANDLING DECISION, NOT A PREFERENCE.

A symptom description is the most sensitive free text in this app. Pointing
this at a hosted endpoint transmits it to a third party, and CLAUDE.md records
that this project has a signed BAA with nobody. A local endpoint transmits
nothing and is the only option here that raises no BAA question at all — the
same reasoning that put label OCR on the device.

`endpoint_is_local()` exists so that distinction is visible rather than
assumed, and a hosted endpoint logs a warning naming the exposure the first
time it is used. Neither of those makes a hosted endpoint safe; they stop it
being silent.

NOTHING IS LOGGED FROM THE BODY. The description travels in the request and
must not reach the application log — see the logging rule in CLAUDE.md. Errors
here report a type and a status code, never content.

    3. the `LLM_*` settings, which is the behaviour of having none of this.

    Leaving all of them unset is exactly the behaviour of not having these
    settings at all — the property a test asserts, because "this changes
    nothing unless you ask for it" is the whole reason it was safe to add.

    ⛔ THE `GOALS_LLM_*` FALLBACK IS ALL-OR-NOTHING, DELIBERATELY. It used to
    fall back field by field, so an operator who set the goals URL and key but
    left the model blank got Groq's URL and key with the *other* provider's
    model name. That combination is not a working endpoint of either provider —
    it fails as `model_not_found`, which reaches the user as a silent "no
    suggestions".

    Per-field fallback only makes sense when both point at the same provider,
    and the entire purpose of these settings is that they do not. So the base
    URL decides: name one, and the model and key must come from beside it.
    `GROQ_API_KEY` is not an exception to that rule but an instance of it — the
