"""
Published guidance a proposed activity can be attributed to.

⛔ READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A LINE. The repository owner asked twice for goal
plans that are "proven", and this is the only form of that MedHelp is allowed
to ship: a row is attributed to a **published recommendation from a named
public health body, quoted verbatim, with a link**. It is the same shape as
the MedlinePlus rule that already governs every other piece of sourced health
content in this app, and it exists so that the evidence in front of a person
is somebody's published work rather than a language model's assertion.

## What a citation here claims, and what it does not

A citation says: *this kind of activity is the subject of this published
recommendation.* That is all.

It does **not** say the plan will work, that the guidance endorses this plan,
that it applies to this person, or that anything here was reviewed. The
guidance is about a behaviour in general; the goal, the schedule and the
wording of the row are MedHelp's. ⛔ **Every surface that renders a citation
must say so**, because a government logo under a model-written row reads as
endorsement unless something stops it reading that way.

## The rules, each asserted by a test

- ⛔ **Quotes are verbatim and complete.** Never paraphrase, trim to a
  fragment, or stitch two sentences together. A paraphrased guideline is
  app-authored clinical content wearing a citation, which is worse than no
  citation at all. A sleep-duration entry was dropped for exactly this reason:
  the figure is published as a table cell ("7 or more hours") and any sentence
  carrying it would have been written here.
- ⛔ **No agent may invent an entry.** Every one needs a real published
  document, fetched and quoted, and a human review pass. The register is
  deliberately short.
- ⛔ **An unknown domain gets no citation, never the nearest one.** Snapping a
  row to the closest domain is the same defect as snapping a misread drug name
  to the nearest real drug: it turns a visible gap into a plausible error.
- ⛔ **Nothing here may become an input to triage, or to anything that
  estimates urgency.** It is attribution for a lifestyle activity.

## Why a closed vocabulary

The model picks a `domain` id from this register and cannot supply a URL, a
publisher or a quote of its own — the same reason `CARE_SETTINGS` is a fixed
list in provider search. A model asked for a citation will produce a
plausible-looking one; a model asked to choose from eight ids either chooses
one or does not.

NOT REVIEWED BY A CLINICIAN. Which behaviour a goal should be pointed at is a
judgement, and the mapping from a row to a domain is made by the model. See
`docs/health-goals-prompt.md`.
