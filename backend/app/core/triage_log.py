"""
Structured record of what the classifier did, for later review.

WHY: CLAUDE.md records that this classifier has no validated error profile —
nobody has measured its under-triage rate. That cannot change until there is
something to measure. This module writes the line a reviewer would need:
what was described, what was asked and answered, what tier came out, and how
confident the model was.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is not the audit trail. The durable record is the
`intake_assessments` table, written only with the user's consent. This is a
development aid — it goes to the application log, where it is useful while
tuning and worthless afterwards.

## The rule that governs this file

**Descriptions are health data and must never reach the application log in a
deployment that could hold real ones.** CLAUDE.md is explicit: "Do not log
request/response bodies that contain user health data." So:

* Logging is OFF unless `TRIAGE_LOG_CLASSIFICATIONS=true` is set explicitly.
* It refuses to turn on when `ENVIRONMENT=production`, whatever the flag says.
  A flag flipped in the wrong place is exactly how this kind of leak happens,
  so the environment check is not something the operator can override here.
* Even switched on, the description is truncated and the record carries a
  banner saying it must contain synthetic data only.

Turning this on in an environment holding real user descriptions would be a
reportable data-handling failure. It exists to tune the classifier against
made-up inputs.

    Whether classification logging may run at all.

    ⛔ ONLY A RECOGNISED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT MAY LOG. The flag is never
    sufficient on its own.

    This used to read `if settings.environment == "production"`, an exact
    string match, while `settings.is_development` normalises with
    `.strip().lower()`. So the rest of the app treated `Production`,
    `PRODUCTION` and `production ` as production — strict signing key, no
    wildcard CORS, no `/docs` — and this module did not, and would have written
    health descriptions to the application log of a production deployment.

    Inverting the test to `is_development` fixes more than the spelling. The
    question this module has to answer is not "is this production?" but "is
    this somewhere a real person may have typed?", and the only environments it
    can be sure about are the ones it recognises. A deployment called `staging`
    or `prod` can hold real descriptions; under the old check both logged
    freely, because neither is the string "production".

    ⛔ Fail safe. An unrecognised environment refuses.
