"""
Loader for a LICENSED telephone-triage protocol set. Ships with no content.

## Why this exists

Every phrase in `rules_triage.py` and `emergency.py` was, in that file's own
words, "written by a software engineer". That is the release blocker recorded
in CLAUDE.md, and it is not a blocker that more phrases can clear: the problem
is authorship, not coverage. The fix is to stop being the author and load
content somebody qualified wrote — a licensed telephone-triage protocol set of
the kind medical call centres run on, reviewed by practising physicians and
revised against current literature.

This module is the container for that content. It is deliberately **all
container and no content**.

## ⛔ What is NOT here, and must never be added

**No protocol content.** Not a sample, not a fixture, not "just one to show
the shape". A protocol written by an agent or an engineer and loaded through
this interface would be unreviewed clinical content wearing the interface
built for reviewed clinical content — strictly worse than the phrase lists,
which at least say plainly what they are. `tests/test_protocol_content.py`
asserts no content file exists in this repository.

**No disposition-to-tier mapping of our own.** Deciding that "be seen within
24 hours" means URGENT rather than EMERGENT is a clinical judgement, so the
loader *requires* each disposition to state its tier and refuses content that
omits one. The mapping arrives with the content, or with the clinician who
reviews the integration. It is never inferred here.

## Built, gated, and unreachable

Nothing calls this module. It is not wired into `rules_triage.classify` or
`triage.py`, exactly as `BookingIdentityScreen` is built and unreachable
behind `delivery_available()`. Two reasons:

* With no content it would be a no-op on every request, so wiring it in buys
  nothing and costs a change to a fenced module.
* Attaching a new source of tiers to the live triage path is a change to the
  safety architecture and needs the owner's explicit approval and a
  clinician's read of the integration — the audit CLAUDE.md describes, and
  which a licence normally requires anyway.

`reconcile()` below is the whole of the intended attachment, and it is written
so that a reviewer can see it cannot lower a tier.

## Fails closed

Any malformed protocol rejects the **entire** set rather than loading the part
that parsed. Half a protocol set is not a smaller protocol set: it is a set
with unknown holes in it, and a hole in triage content reads as "nothing to
worry about". `available()` returns False whenever loading did not fully
succeed.
