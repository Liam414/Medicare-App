"""
Follow-up prompts for descriptions the app could not make sense of.

WHY THIS EXISTS: "I've been feeling off since this morning" matches no rule
and no health topic, so it produced a default tier and an empty screen. The
fix is to ask for more, the way any intake process does.

WHAT THESE QUESTIONS ARE: neutral elicitation. They ask the person to say
more about what they already said — where it is, how long, what else, how it
started, whether it has changed. They are the questions a receptionist asks,
not the ones a clinician asks.

WHAT THEY ARE DELIBERATELY NOT: clinical screening. There is no "does the
pain radiate to your arm", no "is the rash blanching", nothing that encodes a
threshold or tests a hypothesis. Those are clinical judgements, and CLAUDE.md
does not permit this app to author them. Every question below is fixed and
readable in one sitting — which is what makes it reviewable, and what keeps
it short of practising.

TWO ROUNDS, NOT ONE. The first round is identical for everyone. The second is
chosen from a fixed list by a short, readable rule from what the first round
returned, so someone who could not be understood is asked something *new*
rather than the same four prompts again. The selection is deterministic: the
same answers always produce the same questions, which is what a clinical
review needs. It is also capped — after round two the safe default is applied
and stated plainly, and the cap cannot be lifted by anything a client sends.

Rules that hold, each asserted by a test:

1. **A red-flag description is never asked anything, in any round.** Emergency
   screening runs first and routes straight to emergency guidance. Standing
   between someone describing chest pain and the dial button to ask how long
   it has been going on would be the worst thing this module could do.

2. **The answers are re-screened.** They are merged into the description and
   the whole thing goes through `assess` again from the top, so a red flag
   that first appears in an answer still escalates. Answers are not trusted
   to be less serious than the original text.

3. **Asking always terminates.** A round is only offered if the previous one
   came back with at least one real answer, so a client that submits nothing
   is not looped, and `MAX_ROUNDS` caps it regardless.

4. **The recap only ever repeats the user's own words.** `summarise` pairs a
   fixed label with the text the person typed or the choice they picked. It
   infers nothing, names no condition, and adds no clinical vocabulary — it
   is a receipt for what was heard, not an interpretation of it.

NOT CLINICALLY REVIEWED. Like everything else in intake, these prompts, the
round-two selection rule and the cap were written by a software engineer and
are covered by the blocking sign-off in CLAUDE.md.

# A false detection loses a piece of information the classifier needed, so
# every list below is a closed set of unambiguous words rather than a clever
# guess, and `other` is never skipped (see `questions_for_round`).

      the round off the answer keys precisely because the two sets are
