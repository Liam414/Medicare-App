"""
Agentic urgency deduction: a bounded tool-using loop over this app's own
deterministic screens.

WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT IS NOT A RELAXATION OF THE SAFETY MODEL

The model layer used to be one shot: hand the description over, read a tier
back. This drives a short loop instead. The model must consult the red-flag
screen and the rule layer — the same reviewed phrase lists in
`app.core.emergency` and `app.core.rules_triage` — before it is allowed to
conclude anything, and it records its reasoning a step at a time on the way.

Two things this buys that a single call did not:

1. **Its conclusion is grounded in the reviewed lists, not its memory.** The
   deterministic screens are tools it reads, so "the rules recognised nothing
   here" is an observation it has actually made rather than something it has
   to infer. `conclude` is refused until both have been called.
2. **There is a trace.** CLAUDE.md records that this classifier has no
   validated error profile and that nobody can yet say *why* a wrong call was
   wrong. Each step is captured, so a reviewer reads a derivation instead of
   a verdict.

⛔ WHAT IT DOES NOT CHANGE — the safety architecture is untouched:

* **The rule layer is still the product.** This is still the optional second
  opinion. `app.core.triage` reconciles the two with `max()`, so a deduction
  can raise a tier and can never lower one.
* **The tools are read-only screens.** They take no arguments and always run
  against the description as submitted. A tool that let the model choose the
  text to screen would let it screen a rephrasing and talk itself out of a
  red flag; the deterministic layers see the real words, always.
* **Failure is never SELF_CARE.** Every exit that is not a completed
  conclusion raises `LLMUnavailable`, which the caller turns into "no model
  answer" and the rule tier stands.
* **The tier definitions live in `app.core.triage`** and are passed in. There
  is deliberately not a second copy of the instrument here — a reviewer reads
  one prompt, and this module is only the machinery that drives it.

NOT CLINICALLY VALIDATED, exactly as before. Driving the same unreviewed tier
definitions in more steps does not review them.

HOW TO WORK

Be efficient. Every extra tool call and every extra sentence you generate is \
real time someone anxious about their symptoms spends waiting for an answer. \
Use as few tool calls and as few words as the task allows.

1. Call screen_red_flags. This is the app's own deterministic emergency \
screen. If it matched, the answer is EMERGENT — say so and conclude. You \
cannot reason your way below a red flag.
2. Call apply_rules. This is the app's deterministic rule layer. Read what it \
recognised. If it says the rules recognised nothing, that means the \
description was not understood — which is not evidence that it is minor.
3. Optionally call record_step ONCE if there is something worth noting that a \
reviewer would not already see in the screen results. Skipping it is fine and \
faster — do not use it as a place to think out loud.
4. Call conclude with your tier, as soon as you have read both screens above. \
Do not delay concluding to add more reasoning steps.

conclude is refused until you have called both screens. Do not guess what \
they would have said — read them.

Your answer is only an answer if it arrives as a conclude tool call. Writing \
it as text does nothing: it is not read, and it is not parsed. In particular \
the "tier=..., confidence=..." shape in the examples above is illustration of \
how to reason, not a format to type — do not reproduce it, and do not write \
the word "conclude" as text. Call the tool.

The tools always run against the description exactly as it was submitted. You \
cannot rephrase it for them, and you should not try.\
