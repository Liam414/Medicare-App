class IntakeAssessment(Base):
    """
    Audit trail for symptom intake: what was described, and what tier came back.

    This exists so classifications can be reviewed for accuracy later. A triage
    tool whose decisions cannot be audited cannot be improved or held to
    account, and a clinician reviewing this feature will need exactly these
    rows.

    PHI WARNING. `description` is a free-text account of someone's symptoms —
    among the most sensitive fields in this app. Consequently:

    * A row is written ONLY when the user consented at submission time
      (`consented_to_logging`). Without consent the assessment still runs and
      is still returned; nothing is stored.
    * The column needs encryption at rest before this holds real user data.
      Not implemented — recorded as an open finding in CLAUDE.md.
    * Nothing in this app logs the description to application logs.
