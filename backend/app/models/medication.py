    A medication the user is taking.

    Every column except the identifiers is health data about a specific
    person. Per CLAUDE.md's data rules these fields are the ones that need
    encryption at rest before this holds real user data — not implemented
    yet, and recorded as an open finding.

    Rows are always scoped to `user_id`; no query in the app may read
    medications without filtering on the authenticated user.
