"""
Health goals: what the person said they intend to do, and what they ticked off.

Every column here is health data about a named person - what they are working
on, and on which days they did it. The rules from `models/medication.py` apply
unchanged: rows are always scoped to `user_id`, and these are among the columns
that need encryption at rest before this holds real user data. Not implemented,
recorded as an open finding in CLAUDE.md.

## This is not an adherence record

`GoalCompletion` rows say only that a person pressed a button on a day. They do
not say a person did or did not do something, and nothing in this app may
present them that way - the same rule that makes a passed medication reminder
read "earlier today" rather than "missed". An absent row means nothing was
ticked, which is not evidence of anything.

There is deliberately no streak column, no score, and no percentage stored. A
count of ticks is a count of ticks; anything derived from it that sounds like a
judgement about the person's health would be a clinical fact this app invented.
