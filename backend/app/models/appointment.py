# REQUESTED does not mean anyone outside this phone knows about the visit.
#
#   REQUESTED  The user recorded an intent to be seen. MedHelp has NOT
#              contacted the provider — see `app/services/request_delivery.py`
#              for why that channel does not exist yet.
#   SCHEDULED  The user has spoken to the provider and has a real time.
#              Only the user can move a row here; nothing automated does.
#   COMPLETED  The visit happened.
#   CANCELLED  It is not going ahead.

    A visit the user is tracking, and — where they arrived from symptom intake
    — the urgency context that sent them here.

    PHI WARNING. `reason_for_visit` is a free-text account of why someone needs
    to see a doctor. When it is carried over from symptom intake it is a copy
    of that description, which CLAUDE.md identifies as the most sensitive free
    text in the app. Therefore:

    * It never leaves this database. No third party receives it, because no
      third party this app talks to has signed a BAA.
    * It needs encryption at rest before this holds real user data. Not
      implemented — the same open finding as `medications` and
      `intake_assessments`.
    * Nothing in this module logs it.

    Every query filters on `user_id`, like `medications` — an appointment is
    never reachable by id alone.
