Request and response shapes for health goals.

A draft and a saved goal are separate types on purpose, the same split as
suggestion-versus-schedule in `schemas/reminder.py`. A draft is something
MedHelp proposed and nobody has agreed to yet; a goal is what the person
confirmed on screen. Keeping them apart in the API makes it hard to
accidentally treat the first as the second.
