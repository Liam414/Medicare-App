"""
The user's appointments - the tracking feature, and the destination of the
"request an appointment" flow.

Every row here is health data about one person. The same two rules as
`medications` hold throughout:

* Every query filters on the authenticated user. An appointment is never
  reachable by id alone - an unknown id and someone else's id both return 404,
  so the endpoint cannot be used to discover that a record exists.
* Nothing in this module logs the reason for visit, the provider, or the notes.

One rule is specific to this module: **creating an appointment contacts
nobody.** It writes a row and returns it. MedHelp has no BAA-covered channel to
a provider (see `app/services/request_delivery.py`), so `delivery_state` is
NOT_SENT on every row this code can produce, and `provider_notified` is False.
The user still has to phone, and the UI says so.

    The delivery gate, as a dependency so it runs BEFORE the body is parsed.

    ⛔ THIS BEING A DEPENDENCY IS THE POINT, NOT A STYLE CHOICE. `identity:
    BookingIdentity` is a body parameter, so pydantic builds a model holding a
    legal name, a date of birth and a home address before the handler function
    is entered. The gate used to live inside that function, which meant the
    endpoint's own docstring — "refuses before reading the body's meaning ...
    so no identity is processed while there is nowhere to send it" — was false.
    A malformed body answering 422 was the proof: that code can only come from
    validation having already run.

    FastAPI resolves dependencies before validating a body, so raising here
    means no `BookingIdentity` is ever constructed while delivery is
    unavailable — which is every request today.

    The exposure closed is small: nothing stored it, nothing returned it, and
    `BookingIdentity.__repr__` is redacted. But this is the only endpoint in
    the app that touches a date of birth, and the design it belongs to is
    explicitly "two independent guards, because the cost of getting this wrong
