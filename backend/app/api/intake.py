    Every phrase in `emergency.py` and `rules_triage.py` is compiled with word
    boundaries, so two phrases run together match NOTHING. That is a bug this
    repository has already had in production: a pasted list arriving as
    "Chest painShortness of breath" was screened as neither, and fell to the
    URGENT default instead of EMERGENT. `normalize_query` splits a
    lowercase-to-uppercase boundary afterwards and would catch that particular
    shape, but it cannot catch "a feverchills", and a feature whose whole job
    is to build a list must not be the thing that manufactures the glue.

    So the join is ". " — the same separator `followup.merge` uses, and for
    the same reason: the combined text goes through emergency screening, the
    rules and the lookup as one description, and every phrase in it has to be
    reachable by a word-boundary match.

    Reading material for whatever the user described, from a vetted source.

    The raw description is not searched directly: conversational phrasing
    ("my ankle's been killing me since I rolled it") matches nothing, and that
    empty result is why a tier used to arrive with nothing attached to it.
    `candidate_queries` strips the filler and then broadens a word at a time.

    Results are kept only if one of the names the SOURCE gives the topic — its
    title or one of its own published alternate titles — contains a word the
    user actually wrote. The upstream ranking is loose enough to answer
    "swollen ankle" with "Diabetic Heart Disease", and showing that beside
    someone's description would imply a diagnosis. A query whose results all
    fail that check is treated as a miss and the search broadens instead.

    Matching the alternate titles as well as the title is what stops the check
    rejecting the source's own vocabulary: NLM files bunions under "Toe
    Injuries and Disorders" and sunburn under "Sun Exposure", so a title-only
    test told those users nothing matched.

    A failure here is not fatal: the tier and the escalation path matter far
