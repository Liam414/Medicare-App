"""
Health goals: the person writes what they intend to do, and ticks it off.

Every row here is health data about a named person. The rules from
`api/medications.py` apply unchanged:

* Every query filters on the authenticated user. An unknown goal id and
  someone else's goal id both return 404, so this cannot be used to discover
  that a record exists.
* Nothing in this module logs a goal title, an activity, or a description.

## MedHelp proposes. It never saves.

`POST /goals/draft` proposes a plan — activities, the days they fall on and
the time of day for each — and **writes nothing**; a test asserts a draft
leaves the user with no goals. Rows exist only after `POST /goals` sends back
what the person confirmed on screen, the same read-then-confirm shape as
medication reminders.

⛔ Since 2026-09-12 that plan is authored by MedHelp for **any** goal,
including a medical one, and no deterministic check screens it. The refusal
that used to turn "get my blood pressure down" into a dead end was removed at
the repository owner's request. Read the module docstring of
`core/goal_structuring.py` before changing anything on this path — what
guards it is a prompt, not a check.

## Emergency screening runs first, and before any vendor

A goal box is a free-text health input like any other in this app. Someone will
type "stop feeling dizzy on the stairs" into it. `screen_for_emergency` runs on
the submitted text before the model is called, its guidance is returned
alongside whatever else happened, and it is never withheld because a later step
failed - the same contract as symptom search.

## The sentences a person reads are written here

`core/goal_structuring.py` returns a refusal *code*. The wording lives in
`_REFUSAL_NOTICES` below, for the same reason `emergency.py` owns its guidance
copy: user-facing text in a health app is reviewed text, and a model writing
its own apology is unreviewed text on a screen.

NOT REVIEWED BY A CLINICIAN. See the note in `core/goal_structuring.py`.

    Edit a saved goal: its title, and its activities and their schedules.

    Before this existed the only way to change a goal was to delete it and
    write it again, which threw away every tick along with it. Playtesting
    reported it as the obvious missing thing, and it was.

    ## Rows are matched by id, and that is the whole design

    A `GoalCompletion` points at an activity id. Replacing the activity rows on
    every save - the easy implementation - would silently discard the person's
    ticks for every goal they ever edited, including ticks from today.

    So each incoming row either carries the `id` of a row already on this goal,
    in which case it is edited in place and keeps its history, or carries none
    and is created. Rows the payload leaves out are removed, along with their
    completions: SQLite does not enforce the cascade, which is why
    `delete_goal` deletes them explicitly and why this does too.

    ⛔ An `id` that is not on this goal is a 400, never a new row. Treating it
    as new would let a typo or a stale client quietly detach a row from its
    ticks, which is the failure this whole function is shaped to avoid, and
    accepting another goal's id would let one goal's edit reach into another.

    ## What it may not do

    ⛔ It writes no activity text of its own and proposes nothing. Everything
    here was typed or confirmed by the person on the editor screen - the same
    read-then-confirm shape as saving in the first place. `generated` is not a
    column, so nothing has to be cleared: a row the person has edited is simply
    a row they are now saving as their own.

    ⛔ `cadence` and `times_per_week` are derived from `days` rather than
    trusted from the client, exactly as `_validate_plan` derives them, so a
    goal cannot end up saying "three times a week" beside four ticked days.
