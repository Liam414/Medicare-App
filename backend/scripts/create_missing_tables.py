"""
Create any tables that do not exist yet in the configured database.

WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A MIGRATION: CLAUDE.md names Alembic as the
migration tool, but it is still not wired up — the same gap that
`add_intake_audit_columns.py` works around. Nothing in the app calls
`create_all` at startup, so a new model (such as `appointments`) has no table
until someone makes one.

`create_all` creates missing tables and **never alters existing ones**. That
makes it safe to re-run, and useless for a column added to a table that already
exists — for that, see `add_intake_audit_columns.py`.

Run from `backend/`:

    python scripts/create_missing_tables.py

This is a development convenience, not a release process. Set Alembic up before
anything real runs.
