"""
Synthetic corpus for measuring symptom-intake triage, with gold urgency tiers.

SYNTHETIC ONLY. Every description here was written by an engineer against no
real person. CLAUDE.md forbids real symptom data anywhere in this repository,
and that applies with more force here than anywhere else in it: this file is
nothing but symptom descriptions.

## ⛔ What a gold label here is, and what it is not

`gold` is **the tier this app's own documented intent says it should return**,
not a clinical judgement about a real presentation. Each case records `basis`
so a reviewer can see where its label came from:

* `screening intent: X`   — emergency.py defines category X and this
                            description is a lay phrasing of it.
* `urgent rule: X`        — rules_triage.py defines urgent rule X and this
                            description is a lay phrasing of it.
* `self-care list`        — a recognised self-limiting complaint with no
                            escalating modifier.
* `safe default`          — nothing is recognised, so URGENT is correct *by
                            design*: "not recognised is not the same as
                            harmless".
* `documented gap`        — CLAUDE.md records this as currently missed. These
                            are expected to fail until the gap is closed, and
                            are the cases a fix has to move.

So a score from this corpus measures **consistency with documented intent and
regression against it**. It is NOT a validation of the instrument, and a
number from it must never be described as clinical accuracy. The labels were
assigned by a software engineer; a clinician has reviewed neither them nor the
tier definitions they encode. That review is the release blocker recorded in
CLAUDE.md and this file does not touch it.

What the corpus IS good for: telling you whether a change to the phrase lists
or the matcher made screening more sensitive, less sensitive, or neither —
which is a question nobody could previously answer without reading the diff
and reasoning about it.

## `natural`

True when the description is phrased the way a person would actually write
it, rather than containing a phrase copied out of the lists. Matching your own
phrase list is trivially easy; the accuracy that matters is on paraphrases, so
`measure.py` reports the two separately. Treat the natural-phrasing number as
the real one.
