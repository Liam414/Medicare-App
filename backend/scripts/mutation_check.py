Mutation pass over the safety properties of health goals and symptom triage.

    cd <repo root>
    python backend/scripts/mutation_check.py            # everything
    python backend/scripts/mutation_check.py goals      # one group
    python backend/scripts/mutation_check.py triage

For each rule these features claim to enforce, this breaks it and checks the
suite notices. A mutation that SURVIVES is a rule nothing is actually testing.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Four times in one sitting the goals feature had a test that
was green for a reason unrelated to what it claimed:

  - the goals screen's ticks asserted `accessibilityState`, which passes in
    jsdom whether or not anything reaches the DOM
  - the shape bands' attribution rule explained every rejection once the floor
    was set to something unsatisfiable
  - the prompt-ordering test matched a cross-reference rather than a heading
  - and the two complexity tests, found by this script: both used a one-row
    plan, so replacing the discard with `complexity = "moderate"` still failed
    the moderate ROW COUNT. They demonstrated "one row is not three rows"
    while claiming to demonstrate "a missing reading is refused"

A passing suite is evidence about the tests, not about the code. This is the
cheapest way to tell them apart, and it needs no model and no key.

⛔ IT NEVER TOUCHES THE WORKING TREE. Every mutation is applied to a throwaway
COPY of `backend/`, and the suite runs there. An earlier version edited files
in place and restored them in a `finally`, which left a window where an
interrupted run would strand a mutated source file — observed once, on a real
run. That is merely untidy for `goal_structuring.py`. It is unacceptable for
`triage.py`, so the design changed rather than the reassurance.

⛔ THE TRIAGE GROUP READS FENCED MODULES AND CHANGES NONE OF THEM. CLAUDE.md
forbids modifying `triage.py`, `rules_triage.py` and `emergency.py`, and
permits adding tests for them. This adds no test to them and modifies nothing:
it copies them, breaks the copy, and deletes it. The committed files are never
opened for writing — check `git status` after a run and it will say so.

⛔ A SURVIVOR IS NOT FIXED BY DELETING THE MUTATION. Fix the test.

⛔ BUT CHECK THE MUTATION ACTUALLY CHANGES BEHAVIOUR FIRST. A mutation that
edits the source without changing what it does reports SURVIVED and is
indistinguishable, in this output, from a rule nothing tests. It has happened
here: `db.query(...).delete()` was rewritten to `_unused = db.query(...)`,
which still calls `.delete()` on the same chain. That read as a missing test
for a cascade that was working perfectly.

The anchor count catches a mutation that could not be applied. Nothing can
catch one that applied and meant nothing — that is a judgement about the code,
so read the diff a survivor implies before believing it.

⛔ AND CHECK THE GROUP ACTUALLY RUNS THE FILE THAT TESTS THE RULE. Each group
in `SUITES` runs a fixed tuple of test files, so a mutation whose test lives
outside that tuple survives no matter how well tested the rule is — a third
way to read SURVIVED, and the least obvious of the three.

It happened on 2026-09-20. "medication_reminders copies the medication name"
was added to `privacy` and reported SURVIVED, while the test that catches it
sat in `test_reminders_api.py`, which only `integrity` ran. The rule was fully
tested and the tool said nothing was testing it.

So a survivor means one of three things, in the order worth checking:

1. the group does not run the file where the rule is asserted — look at
   `SUITES` first, it is the cheapest to rule out;
2. the mutation applied but changed no behaviour — read the diff it implies;
3. genuinely, nothing tests the rule — and only then, write the test.

Not part of `pytest`: it runs the suite once per mutation, which takes minutes.
