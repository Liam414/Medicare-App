/**
 * Shared page frame: a flat background, consistent padding, clear of the
 * keyboard, scrolling when content doesn't fit.
 *
 * Scrolling matters for accessibility as much as for small screens — at large
 * system font sizes these screens overflow even on a big phone, and a
 * non-scrolling View would put the submit button permanently out of reach.
 *
 * It draws two of the three things that make this app look like itself:
 *
 * - **The ground**, a quiet neutral surface.
 * - **The meter**, a measured colour edge down the leading side, saying which
 *   part of the app this is. See `meter`, and `useDomain` for how a screen
 *   declares its colour.
 *
 * The third is `ScreenBand`, passed in as `band` so this component can bleed
 * it to the full width while the content below it stays in a readable column.

   *
   * ## Why this exists
   *
   * Every screen but Today was a single 480–660pt column in the middle of a
   * browser window, which left roughly half the width as bare ground. On the
   * ruled paper that reads emptier than it did on a flat one, because the grid
   * makes the emptiness measurable.
   *
   * ⛔ **This is not a slot for filler, and above all not for health
   * content.** It takes the same content `InfoPanel` takes and is bound by the
   * same fence: statements about the *software* — what it does with what you
   * just typed, what it will not do, where the data goes. No clinical text, no
   * numbers about the person's health, nothing a reviewer has not read. Read
   * the note at the top of `InfoPanel` before putting anything here.
   *
   * The content column keeps its own `wide`/`form` cap, so nothing here
   * lengthens a line of body text.

   * desktop. A 1180pt line of body text is harder to read than a 660pt one,
