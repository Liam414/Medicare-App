/**
 * The frame around sign-in and sign-up.
 *
 * On a phone this is exactly what those two screens were before: a heading, a
 * subtitle, and the form, centred in a narrow column. On a wide browser window
 * it becomes two panels — what the app is on the left, the form on the right —
 * because the sign-in screen is the first thing anyone opening the public link
 * sees, and a 480pt form floating in the middle of a 1400pt window told a
 * first-time visitor nothing at all about what they had just opened.
 *
 * ## The panel is the app's index, and it teaches the colour code
 *
 * The five rows are the five places `AppNav` navigates between, each carrying
 * the hue it will have once you are inside. So the first screen a person sees
 * is also the legend for the wayfinding they are about to use — a lab report
 * prints its reference panel for the same reason.
 *
 * That is why the panel sits on white rather than on a dark ground: the
 * colours are the thing worth looking at here, and a dark panel would mute
 * every one of them.
 *
 * ⛔ The panel is a description of the software, not a pitch and not health
 * content. Every line restates a sentence the app already shows on the home
 * screen, so signing in makes no claim that using the app then contradicts.
 * Nothing here may name a condition, suggest what a symptom means, or imply
 * the app decides anything clinical — see CLAUDE.md, App Scope.

  // not decide what your goals should be" — and CLAUDE.md says plainly that the

  // account ever reads, describing the app as recording choices it in fact
  // authors. Restates `GoalCreateScreen`'s own subtitle, per the rule above.
