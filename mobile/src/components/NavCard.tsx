/**
 * A destination the user can press.
 *
 * The generous hit area is deliberate: this app is used one-handed, sometimes
 * by people who are unwell, and a card is far easier to hit accurately than a
 * row of small text links.
 *
 * The glyph and the chevron are decoration and affordance respectively —
 * neither carries information the title and description do not already state,
 * so the card reads the same to a screen reader as it does on screen.
 *
 * ## The three variants are the prominence ladder
 *
 * See `PROMINENCE_LEVELS` in `theme.ts`. Without it, every destination on a
 * hub screen is drawn identically, which means nothing is primary and a
 * reader has to read all of them to choose one.
 *
 * - `primary` (L1) — filled in the destination's colour. **One per screen.**
 * - `card` (L2) — surface with a hairline border and a colour spine on its
 *   leading edge. A standalone destination.
 * - `row` (L2) — the same thing with no edges of its own, for use inside a
 *   `NavGroup`, which draws one border around the set and rules between them.
 *
 * ## `to` is what makes the spine worth drawing
 *
 * A card's colour is the colour of the place it *goes*, which is why it takes
 * a `to` rather than inheriting the screen it sits on. On a screen where every
 * card leads somewhere different — the Today screen, mainly — the spine tells
 * you which part of the app a press will land you in before you have read the
 * title, and the colour matches the tab that lights up when you get there.
 *
 * Left unset, it falls back to the current screen's domain, which is the right
 * answer for a list of destinations that all live in one place.
