/**
 * Medication reminders in a browser.
 *
 * Metro picks this over `notificationService.ts` for web builds. Both expose
 * the same functions so the screens need no platform knowledge.
 *
 * ## What this can and cannot do, stated plainly
 *
 * Notifications are fired **from this page, while it is open**. A browser tab
 * that has been closed runs no code, so it fires nothing. That is a real
 * limitation and the UI says so rather than implying an alarm clock.
 *
 * Making it work with the browser closed needs Web Push: a backend scheduler,
 * push subscriptions, and a payload travelling through Google's, Apple's or
 * Mozilla's push infrastructure. That payload would name a person's
 * medication, which makes those services processors of health data and raises
 * the BAA question this project has no answer to. It also needs HTTPS, so it
 * would not work on the LAN address the app is served from today. Deliberately
 * not built — see the note in CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * ## Nothing leaves the device
 *
 * Every reminder is scheduled and fired locally from data already on screen.
 * There is no `fetch` in this module, and no notification content is sent
 * anywhere. A test asserts it.
