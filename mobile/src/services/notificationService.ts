/**
 * Medication reminders on iOS and Android.
 *
 * Metro picks `notificationService.web.ts` for the browser; this is the native
 * build. Both export the same functions, so the screens are platform-agnostic.
 *
 * ## Why this one is better than the web path
 *
 * `expo-notifications` schedules a **daily repeating local notification with
 * the operating system**. Once handed over, the OS fires it whether or not
 * MedHelp is running — which is what a medication reminder actually needs and
 * what a browser tab cannot do.
 *
 * ## Local, not push
 *
 * These are local notifications only. No push token is requested, nothing is
 * registered with Expo's push service, FCM or APNs, and no medication name
 * leaves the device. That is deliberate: a push payload naming someone's
 * medication would make those services processors of health data and require a
 * BAA this project does not have. **Do not add `getExpoPushTokenAsync` or a
 * remote notification path here without that decision being made first.**
 *
 * ## Requires a development build
 *
 * `expo-notifications` is a native module. Remote notifications were removed
 * from Expo Go on Android in SDK 53, and scheduling behaviour there is
 * unreliable generally, so every import below is lazy and guarded: without the
 * native module the feature reports itself unavailable and the screen says so
 * rather than crashing.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Untested on a device.** There is no development build or hardware in
 * this environment, so the code path below has been written against the
 * documented API and unit-tested against a mock, but never observed firing a
 * real notification. The web path has been checked end to end.
