/**
 * The emergency card: what it holds, and how it is read and written.
 *
 * Shared by both platforms. The only thing that differs is where the bytes
 * land — see `deviceStorage.ts` / `.web.ts`.
 *
 * ## ⛔ This is the one screen that must work when nothing else does
 *
 * The card is read from **on-device storage and nothing else**. There is no
 * `fetch` in this module, no API call behind the card screen, and a test
 * asserts it. A person holding an unlocked phone in an emergency may have no
 * signal, no data allowance, and a backend that is down; a card that needed
 * any of those would be a card that failed at the only moment it mattered.
 *
 * ## ⛔ MedHelp does not author, check, or interpret anything on this card
 *
 * Every field is free text the user typed, stored verbatim and rendered
 * verbatim. Nothing here parses an allergy, recognises a condition, validates
 * a blood type, or reasons about any of it — that would be app-authored
 * clinical content, which CLAUDE.md forbids outright. The card is a place to
 * write something down, not an assessment.
 *
 * Nothing reads this card either. It is not an input to triage, to the
 * emergency screening, or to anything else; those modules are fenced and
 * untouched.
 *
 * ## Where the data lives, and what that costs
 *
 * Allergies, conditions and the blood type are typed here and **never sent to
 * the MedHelp backend at all**. That is deliberate: the backend has no
 * encryption at rest (an open finding in CLAUDE.md), so the safest place for
 * new health data is a store it never reaches. The cost is that the card does
 * not follow the user to another device, and the editor says so.
 *
 * The medication mirror below is the exception in kind, and is discussed on
 * `mirrorMedications`.

 * it is `localStorage`, which survives the tab closing. It is stated on the
 * card, stated in the editor, and `clearCard()` removes it.
 *
 * ## What is copied
 *
 * Name and dosage, of at most `MIRRORED_MEDICATION_LIMIT` medications, each
 * field capped. Not the prescribing doctor, not the notes, not the refill
 * dates — none of that helps a responder, and every field left out is a field
 * that cannot leak from here. The cap is also what keeps the record inside
 * Android's SecureStore size limit.

 * Never throws. A mirror that fails to write costs the card its medication
 * list; it must not cost the user their medication screen.
