/**
 * Write a goal, then confirm the activities MedHelp read out of it.
 *
 * ## MedHelp proposes. The person decides.
 *
 * "Suggest activities" writes nothing on the server. It returns a draft, the
 * draft lands in these fields, and the person edits it before pressing save —
 * the same read-then-confirm shape as `ReminderEditScreen`, and the same
 * reason: MedHelp must not put words in someone's mouth about their own
 * health.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of row, and the person can always tell them apart
 *
 * The usual row is one MedHelp proposed: an activity it wrote, on days it
 * picked, at a time it chose. Those rows are `generated` and they say so on
 * screen. ⛔ Never render a suggested row without that label — a person must
 * be able to tell which lines are theirs, and editing a row's text clears the
 * label because the line has become theirs.
 *
 * The other row quotes the person. It appears when the planner could not
 * answer and the server fell back to splitting what they wrote; the server
 * checked that each row quotes their text, and `sourcePhrase` is shown
 * beneath it so that is visible rather than taken on trust. Those rows carry
 * no schedule, because a time MedHelp invented would be a quantity the person
 * never wrote — the day chips and the time field start empty and they fill
 * them in.
 *
 * A draft can legitimately be empty — no model configured, an outage, or a
 * refusal. The screen then shows the server's sentence and an empty row to
 * type into. There is never a generated fallback plan.
 *
 * ## ⛔ What this screen must keep saying
 *
 * Since 2026-09-12 MedHelp proposes a plan for **any** goal, a medical one
 * included, and no deterministic check screens what it proposes. The footnote
 * above the save button is what tells the person that what they are looking
 * at was written by software and reviewed by nobody. It is not decoration.
 *
 * Nothing here interprets a goal beyond proposing activities for it. It does
 * not say whether a goal is realistic or advisable, and it never explains
 * what an activity will do for the person — a benefit claim is the app making
 * a health claim, which is the line this feature is still built around.

            ⛔ This replaced "MedHelp does not decide what your goals should
            be", which stopped being true on 2026-09-12 when the app started
            proposing plans for any goal. A statement about the software that
            no longer describes the software is worse than none, and this one
            sits where a person reads it before saving an authored plan.

            It is not the reviewed `DisclaimerBanner`, which this screen has
            never carried — which screens show that is fenced in CLAUDE.md and
            is a reviewer's call, not a layout one.

            ⛔ THE FIRST SENTENCE IS CONDITIONAL, AND THE REST IS NOT.

            This block renders whenever there is any row at all, and a row
            is not always MedHelp's. Where no model is configured — every
            deployment without a key — `draft` returns nothing, the person
            types the plan themselves, and the screen was then telling them
            their own careful choices were "suggestions written by MedHelp".
            Simply untrue, about the one thing on this screen whose job is
            to say what a person is looking at.

            ⛔ The remainder is NOT conditional and must not become so.
            Nobody medically qualified has checked any of this either way,
            and a goal about a condition, a medicine or a big change to
            eating or exercise is worth a professional's view whoever wrote
            the rows. CLAUDE.md requires all three of those statements.
