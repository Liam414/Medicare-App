 * screen never says "missed", never scores a day, and never shows a
 * percentage, for the same reason a passed medication reminder reads "earlier
 * today": MedHelp has no idea what anyone actually did, and implying otherwise
 * invents a clinical fact about them.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not add streaks, adherence figures, or "3 of 4 done" tiles here. That
 * is the same mistake CLAUDE.md warns about for the home screen's panels.
 *
 * ## Nothing on this screen is health advice
 *
 * The activity text is the person's own words. MedHelp does not comment on it,
 * rank it, or explain what it might do for them.

 * ⛔ **Do not write that MedHelp only tracks what you decide to do.** That
 * sentence was true until 2026-09-12 and CLAUDE.md now forbids its return:
 * the app proposes a plan for any goal typed in, so describing itself as a
 * passive tracker would be a false statement about the instrument. This panel

                    This version of React Native Web never reads
                    `accessibilityState` at all — it is absent from the
                    forwarded props and from `createDOMProps`, which take
                    `aria-checked` instead — so every row rendered with
                    `aria-checked` null. Verified in a browser, and then in
                    the library's own source.

                    A ticked box and an unticked one looked different and
                    announced identically, on the one screen whose entire
                    purpose is ticking things off. The editor's day chips were
                    fixed for this in September; the tick itself was missed.

                    ⛔ "not ticked off", never "missed" or "incomplete". An
                    unticked row means nothing was ticked — MedHelp has no
                    idea whether the person did it, and this is not an
                    adherence record. Same rule as the visible copy.

                  four more lines under each of up to five activities, and the
                  screen a person opens to tick two boxes became a wall of

                  is part of deciding whether to accept a row — and this screen

                  ⛔ FOLDED, NOT DROPPED. The rule in core/goal_evidence.py is
                  that every surface rendering a citation carries its caveat,
                  and that still holds: closed, this renders no publisher, no
                  document and no quote, so there is nothing to read as an
                  endorsement; open, it renders all four exactly as the editor
                  does. Never show the publisher's name on the closed control
                  — a government name under a MedHelp-written row is the
                  endorsement the caveat exists to prevent, and a control is
                  not a place the caveat can follow it.

                      Found by opening this screen in a real browser: React
                      Native Web drops `accessibilityState={{ expanded }}`
                      entirely — the rendered control carries no
                      `aria-expanded` at all. And `accessibilityLabel`
                      overrides the visible text for a screen reader, so with
                      a fixed label a reader heard exactly the same thing
                      whether the citation was open or closed, while a sighted
                      user saw "Where this comes from" become "Hide where this

                      This is the same defect, and the same fix, as the goal

                      leaving it to something the platform may not render.
                      `expanded` is kept as well, so the fix survives a
                      platform that does honour it.
