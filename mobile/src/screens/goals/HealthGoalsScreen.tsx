 * nothing was ticked — not that anything was missed, skipped or failed. The
 * screen never says "missed", never scores a day, and never shows a
 * percentage, for the same reason a passed medication reminder reads "earlier
 * today": MedHelp has no idea what anyone actually did, and implying otherwise
 * invents a clinical fact about them.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not add streaks, adherence figures, or "3 of 4 done" tiles here. That
 * is the same mistake CLAUDE.md warns about for the home screen's panels.
 *
 * ## Nothing on this screen is health advice
 *
 * The activity text is the person's own words. MedHelp does not comment on it,
 * rank it, or explain what it might do for them.

/**
 * ⛔ Statements about the *software*. No streaks, no percentages, no "3 of 4
 * done" — `GoalScreens.test.tsx` asserts those words never appear, and this
 * column is the obvious place someone would try to add them.
 *
 * ⛔ **Do not write that MedHelp only tracks what you decide to do.** That
 * sentence was true until 2026-09-12 and CLAUDE.md now forbids its return:
 * the app proposes a plan for any goal typed in, so describing itself as a
 * passive tracker would be a false statement about the instrument. This panel
 * says who wrote the plan instead, which is the thing a reader needs.
