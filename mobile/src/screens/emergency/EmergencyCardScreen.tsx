/**
 * What someone would want to read off a phone held out to them.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Every row is always rendered, filled or not
 *
 * A missing blood type shows as "Not provided", never as an absent row.
 * Hiding an empty field would let "no allergies shown" read as "no
 * allergies", which is the most dangerous thing this screen could imply. The
 * gap is information, and a responder scanning this needs to see it.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Nothing on this screen is checked, interpreted, or authored by MedHelp
 *
 * The values are free text the user typed, rendered verbatim. Nothing parses
 * an allergy, recognises a condition, or reasons about any of it — see the
 * module note on `emergencyCard.ts`. The screen says so out loud, because a
 * red header carries an authority the content has not earned.
 *
 * ## ⛔ No network, on purpose
 *
 * Everything here comes from on-device storage. There is no API call on this
 * screen and there must never be one: the moment this is read is the moment a
 * request is most likely to fail.
 *
 * ## Why the header is this loud
 *
 * The rest of MedHelp is deliberately calm, and this screen deliberately is
 * not. It is found under stress, possibly by someone who has never used the
 * app, so it is built to be identifiable in a glance rather than to match the
 * surrounding palette. The ground is `colors.emergencyText` — an existing
 * reviewed value from the emergency family, used here as a fill, which gives
 * white text 10.8:1 rather than the 5.3:1 the lighter border colour would.
 * No token value was changed to build this.
