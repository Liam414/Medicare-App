/**
 * Asks for more detail when the description was not understood.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCREEN EXISTS: "I've been feeling off" matched no rule and no
 * health topic, so it produced a default tier and an empty page. Asking is
 * what any intake process does before answering.
 *
 * The questions come from the server (`app/core/followup.py`) rather than
 * being written here, so there is one reviewable list rather than a copy on
 * each client. They are neutral elicitation — where, how long, what else —
 * and never clinical screening.
 *
 * Two things hold on this screen:
 *
 * 1. `EmergencyCallBar` is present and unconditional. Answering is required
 *    to get a tier, but nothing is required to call 911, and the intro copy
 *    says so.
 * 2. A red-flag description never reaches here at all — the server returns
 *    its emergency guidance immediately instead of asking anything.
