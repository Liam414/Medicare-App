/**
 * ⛔ Mutation pass over the CLIENT's stated safety properties.
 *
 *     cd mobile
 *     node scripts/mutation_check.mjs
 *     node scripts/mutation_check.mjs emergency-card
 *
 * The backend has `backend/scripts/mutation_check.py`; this is the same idea
 * on this side of the wire, and for the same reason. Four times in one sitting
 * this repository had a test that was green for a reason unrelated to what it
 * claimed, and two of those were here:
 *
 *   - the goals screen's ticks asserted `accessibilityState`, which is on the
 *     element in jsdom whether or not anything reaches the DOM — so a ticked
 *     row and an unticked one announced identically under a green suite
 *   - the source disclosure had the same defect, found by opening a browser
 *
 * A passing suite is evidence about the tests, not about the code. Each entry
 * below breaks a rule CLAUDE.md states in as many words and checks the suite
 * notices. A mutation that SURVIVES is a rule nothing is actually testing.
 *
 * ⛔ IT NEVER EDITS THE WORKING TREE. Everything is copied to a scratch
 * directory first and the suite runs there. The scratch lives under `mobile/`
 * rather than the system temp directory for one reason: jest resolves
 * `node_modules` by walking up from `rootDir`, and `mobile/node_modules` is
 * where it has to land. It is removed afterwards, including on a crash.
 *
 * ⛔ A SURVIVOR IS NOT FIXED BY DELETING THE MUTATION. Fix the test.
 *
 * ⛔ BUT CHECK THE MUTATION ACTUALLY CHANGES BEHAVIOUR FIRST. One that edits
 * the source without changing what it does reports SURVIVED and is
 * indistinguishable here from a rule nothing tests. It has happened on the
 * backend side: `db.query(...).delete()` rewritten as `_unused = db.query(...)`
 * still calls `.delete()` on the same chain, and read as a missing test for a
 * cascade that was working. The anchor count catches a mutation that could not
 * be applied; nothing catches one that applied and meant nothing.
 *
 * Not part of `npm test`: it runs the suite once per mutation.
