/**
 * Where the backend is, and whether we may talk to it in the clear.
 *
 * Both of these shipped broken, and together they are why "Find a provider"
 * did nothing for a user running the web build on a phone:
 *
 * 1. `expo export` bakes in `__DEV__ = false`. The old guard refused every
 *    request that was not https whenever `__DEV__` was false — so the exported
 *    build you serve to a phone on your own LAN (the way to run this without
 *    an Apple developer account) rejected every provider search outright,
 *    while sign-in, which had no guard at all, worked fine. The app therefore
 *    looked healthy right up to the moment you searched.
 * 2. With no `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` set, the app called
 *    `http://localhost:8000` — which on a phone is the phone.
 *
 * These exercise the pure functions rather than the module's own constant, on
 * purpose: `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*` is inlined by babel-preset-expo at
 * build time, so it is a literal in the bundle and a test cannot set it. An
 * earlier version of this file tried, and every assertion silently ran against
 * the fallback instead.
