/**
 * Tests for the emergency card store (`emergencyCard.ts`).
 *
 * The properties that matter, in order of how much they would cost to get
 * wrong:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing here touches the network.** The card is read at the moment a
 *    request is most likely to fail, so a `fetch` in this path would be a
 *    feature that works everywhere except where it is needed.
 * 2. **A damaged record reads as an empty card, never as an error.** There is
 *    no failure mode that should stop the card screen rendering.
 * 3. **The medication mirror is capped**, because the record has to fit
 *    inside Android's SecureStore limit and an uncapped list would silently
 *    push it past that and lose the whole card.
 *
 * All values below are invented. No real allergy, condition or contact
 * belongs in this repository.
