/**
 * Tests for the emergency card screen.
 *
 * The two properties that carry safety weight:
 *
 * 1. **An empty field renders as "Not provided", never as a missing row.**
 *    A responder reading a card with no allergies row would reasonably take
 *    that as "no allergies". The gap has to be visible.
 * 2. **The screen makes no request.** It is read when a request is most
 *    likely to fail.
 *
 * All values below are invented.
