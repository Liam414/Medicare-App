/**
 * Tests for the medication form, focused on the confirmation step that a
 * scanned label has to pass through.
 *
 * A misread dose is not like a misread anything else in this app: it changes
 * when and how much of a medication someone takes. So the form is the gate.
 * Scanning prefills it and nothing more — the save is still a person reading
 * the fields and pressing the button.
